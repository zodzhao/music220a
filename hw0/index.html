  Music 220a Homework 0, Spring 2021 <br>
  Hello Computer (Music) <br>

  <h2>
  Part 1
  </h2>
  <p>
  files: <a href="./part1.ck">chuck file</a>, <a href="./part1.wav">WAV audio file</a> <br>

  I chose to work with the file "moe.ck". This file samples the absolute value of a sin function with step size of 0.1, and plays each sample for 100ms. It sounds like bouncing between low frequency to higher frequency sounds. <br>

  I changed the multiplier on line 21 from 4000 to 8000, which is multiplied to the abs(sin()) function to decide the pitch. This widens the frequency range from 0-4000 to 0-8000, and makes it sounds more stretched.

  Part 2
  </h2>
  <p>
  files: <a href="./part2.ck">chuck file</a>, <a href="./part2.wav">WAV audio file</a> <br>

  With the limit of 50 lines, I attempt to include as many things we saw in class as possible. I used the basic sound generation using unit generators, randomness, arrays, if statements, for/while loops, functional programming, and multi-threads. Most importantly it has the "music 220" hidden in the theme :)<br><br>
  First, I translatd the string "music 220" to morse code, and store it in a string array (The translation is done outside of chuck).<br><br>
  Second, I created a function for each of the dot, dash, and space symbol in the string:

  <ul>
  	<li>For the dot ".", I play a SinOsc with reverb at frequency 440 (A4) for 200ms and pause for 40ms.</li>
  	<li>For the dash "-", I play a SinOsc with reverb at frequency randomly chosen from [523.25, 587.33, 659.25] (C5, D5, E5) for 440ms and pause for 40ms (In total, twice the length of the dot symbol).</li>
  	<li>For the space " ", pause for 480 ms by setting th gain to 0. (Same length as the dash symmbol).</li>
  </ul>
  Besides, I created a function to generate a bass sound by sequencially playing a TriOsc sound with reverb at the pitch [A2, C3, E3, C3, E3, A3]. Each for 2.88 seconds, which is the length of 12 dot sounds. <br><br>
  Finally I created a while loop to do the following:
  <ul>
  	<li>Spork a new thread to play the bass part.</li>
  	<li>use a for loop to iterate through the morse code string, and play each sound accordingly by calling the functions defined above.</li>
  </ul>

  The resulting "music" is not too bad. It sounds calm, distant and mysterious...
